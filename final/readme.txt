Project plans
set up turning + forward and backwards on car via signals from ESP8266 using Blynk

Wire up the 2 ultrasonic sensors. 
  Have a speed cap when within a certain distance from another object (distance of 50cm?)
  
Camera setup
  Take picture. Send it to google drive via Temboo/Blynk
    -Once the picture functionality is working, we can potentially add a live feed via camera that can be sent to the phone
  
Car
  Solder core components onto the car
  Find locations on car which can hold the parts without having too much excess sticking off
  Make a simple cover to keep the inside parts safe
